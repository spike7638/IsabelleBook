\chapter*{Introduction}
This text is a formalization of Robin Hartshorne's \emph{Foundations of Projective Geometry}
using the Isabelle proof assistant, primarily relying on Isar. Quotations 
from Hartshorne appear indented, with a blue line to the left. Additional material 
written by either the professor (John (Spike) Hughes) or various students are surrounded by colored 
markers, like this:
\spike
This is something written by Spike
\done
with the black marker indicating the end of the section written by Spike (except that in this case, 
it's part of a larger section Spike wrote). 

Within Isabelle, numbered propositions or theorems from Hartshorne are given names that tie back 
to the text, so Proposition 1.1 in the text is called \texttt{Prop1P1}, with ``P'' replacing the period, 
for instance. 

Students should insert things into the document using
macros associated with their name (in lowercase) to produce a marker indicating the start of their contribution, and the "done" macro to indicate when their contribution is complete. Here are examples of the macro results:

\spike Spike
\david David
\ken Ken
\jackson Jackson
\daniel Daniel
\brad Brad
\justin Justin
\petar Petar
\seiji Seiji
\caleb Caleb
\homer Homer
\siqi Siqi
\haoze Haoze
\done the ``done'' macro.
