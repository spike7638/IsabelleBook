\chapter*{To Do}
\begin{itemize}
\item using sledgehammer: put after "using" or "unfolding" or "have ..." or "show ..." but NOT after "by"
\item in sledgehammer, figure out how to turn on detailed feedback; apparently the magic settings are [verbose, debug] .
\item point people to read the first few pages (up to the "options" section) of the sledgehammer manual: https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/doc/sledgehammer.pdf
\item Also: a bunch of nice facts here -- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21694248/isabelle-why-do-i-get-completely-different-results-when-running-try-versus-sled -- that I might want to incorporate. 
\item explain coding: grey background = isabelle code; purple background = isabelle interface components (buttons, files, panels) or interface-responses (the contents of the 'output' panel, for example), except in the rare cases where these are actual isabelle code; peach background = systems things, like filenames typed into dialog boxes. Because such filenames can also be part of isabelle code, I won't be completely consistent about this, but I'll try to at least be sensible.
\item .Fix spacing in isabelle code style.
\item Move style files to subdirectory
\item Make all latex intermediate files be ignored by git
\item add section on cartouches
\item Fix marginnote to be able to contain "isi" stuff.
\item +For the "sys" and "co" languages, make sure that all characters are un=special (e.g., tildes!)
\item Introduce "Of" and "where" in "using" clauses
\item Why is code "verbatim-like" and can this be fixed? 
\item .Restructure into chapters
\item .define displayed-code macro: Perhaps IC for displayed code? 
\item .Figure out image inclusion
\item .get bibliography working
\item .get non-keyword text in Isabelle source to be ttfamily as well (e.g. presburger)
\item .Define digression-box (add "digression" header)
\item .fix quotes in Isabelle code to be stupid quotes
\item .define clean inline-isabelle macro 
\item .Reduce left margin; increase right margin so marginpars can fit.
\item .get Sys language definition working: fixed wdth font, pale blue background
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Doing proofs right}
Once you've done some more Spivak proofs ... we'll move into affine geometry. 
To prove the affine plane on 4 points is an affine plane, we need to show all the axioms hold. The only really messy one is 
\begin{verbatim}
    "¬ affine_plane_data.collinear
           A4Points
           A4Lines
           A4meets Pa Qa Ra"
\end{verbatim}
Proving a negation \textit{could} be done by expanding the definition of collinear (a conjunction of several items), negating it (using blast), and then showing that each of the resulting disjunction elements is false...but one of these is existentially quantified, so it becomes universally quantified, so it requires working through all possible lines one at a time. 

Instead, the right approach is classical contradiction: we assume they ARE collinear, fix a line $n$ that contains all three, and show this leads to nonsense. (A simple way, in this case, is to observe that the cardinality of $n$ must be at least 3, but the cardinatlity of each line in A4 is exactly 2, but we instead work through the details because it's instructive for later proofs, and ISabelle is good at enumerate-and-check approaches.) 

Warning: I want to use ccontr to show the statement above. My first version said
\begin{IS}
proof (rule ccontr)
    assume cHyp: "affine_plane_data.collinear
           A4Points
           A4Lines
           A4meets Pa Qa Ra"
    ...
\end{IS
but that failed badly. Why? Because the thing you assume must be the negation of the thing you want to prove; I should have written
\begin{IS}
proof (rule ccontr)
    assume cHyp: "¬¬affine_plane_data.collinear
    ...
\end{IS
i.e., simply put a negation sign in front of the desired goal. The fact that ¬¬ is the same as "no negations at all" eludes Isabelle (!)
